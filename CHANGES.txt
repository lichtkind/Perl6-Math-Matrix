    - fixed prefix % and @ ops
    = crosslinking doc headers

 0.2.5:
    § 2018.8.20
    + added MM operator as shortcut for Math::Matrix.new()
    + added constructor that takes a string
    ! .Str outputs now same format that constructor takes
    - removed .full
    + added splice-rows and splice-columns replacing prepend-*, append-* and planned insert-* and delete-*
    + added own methods for .list (flat) and .Array context
    + added proper .gist for type object (like all types have) showing (Math::Matrix)
    + new property cell-type return widest cell type
    = refreshed doc synopsis and description, improved docs overall
    & added .appveyor.yml file: win CI support to github project

 0.2.0:
    § 2018.3.26
    + add methods: add-row, add-column, multiply-row, multiply-column, map-row, map-column
    + add methods move-row, move-column, swap-rows, swap-columns, 
          prepend-vertically, append-vertically, prepend-horizontally, append-horizontally
    + add method elem to check if any cell is equal to value or in a range
    + new property: antisymmetric
    = new category: list like ops
    x submatrix with 2 Int parameter works now as expected
    x accessor column becomes faster
    = move docs into Matrix.pod
    = added docs

 0.1.8:
    § 2018.3.20
    + added method: tensorProduct, alias infix op x, unicode alias ⊗
    + added method: conjugated, is-self-adjoint, is-unitary, is-positive-semidefinite
    - more property setting optimization in constructors
    - new category for methods: structural ops

 0.1.7:
    - 2018.3.18
    - added methods: elems, list-rows and list-columns, full
    - documented, but forgot to implement: commutative + and - op
    - limit gist for optimal shell output
    - change norm names rowsum => row-sum, columnsum => column-sum
    - added docs, operator got own section
